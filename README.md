# Interactive-web-map-scraping

This project would be an ad-hoc scraping code for a specific website for research purposes. The website (https://www.infrapedia.com/app)
contains several elements that I want to transform into a clear and understandable .csv file. I am completely new to python and coding
more generally, but I've read about several packages and ways to obtain this, yet:
- Using the json files of the page does not give me the full set of data that's available on the website, i.e. some categories are missing,
  and I don't know how to tranform the immense json file string into a humanly readable format. They are readable, but I would then need
  to sort them out in a quick way.
- I have started to try to code a scraper with using bs4 based on various guides found online, but I can't yet wrap my head around
  which elements from the inspected page to pick out and put into the code.
